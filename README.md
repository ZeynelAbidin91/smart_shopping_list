## How It Works

The app processes your fridge image using computer vision to detect food items. It then:
1. Filters items based on your dietary preferences
2. Suggests additional items based on your preferred cuisines
3. Allows you to customize the list
4. Generates a QR code containing your shopping list
5. When scanned, displays a formatted text list on your phone
