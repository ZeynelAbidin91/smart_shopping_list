2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

## API Keys Required

## Testing

Test the meal planner functionality:
```bash
python test_meal_planner.py
```

Test the shopping list generation:
```bash
python test_shopping_list.py
```

Test the complete workflow:
```bash
python test_shopping_list.py  # Includes full workflow test
```

## How It Works

The app processes your fridge image using computer vision to detect food items. It then:
1. Filters items based on your dietary preferences
2. Suggests additional items based on your preferred cuisines
3. Allows you to customize the list
4. Generates a QR code containing your shopping list
5. When scanned, displays a formatted text list on your phone
